I'm currently a Developer Advocate at Airbyte as of March 2022. I started my journey after I was laid off from my IT Contracting job
back in 2020 due to Covid. I was heavily passionate about creating content and learning how to code so I spun up an [Instagram](https://instagram.com/chau_codes/) and YouTube channel to document my journey.

On top of creating content, I also started to live-stream on Twitch. I would live-stream all the projects I made, what new technologies, and my interview prep. Fast forward to 2021, I would finally make a break into tech starting as a Developer Support Engineer at Plaid.

I did this for about a year and still had an itch to mesh both my passions together which was coding and content creation. And so I joined Airbyte as a Developer Advocate to be able to make this dream come true. Now my focus is honing my craft to become better every single day. My focus is to document my process to not only keep myself accountable but to also potentially help others in their own journies.
